### The Volcano Corollary
(1st term, Programming-1 course assignment)

# Goals

1. Calculate how many cells are filled with the hot lava for a given rock formation (as a 1D 
int array) in a valley.
2. Write an int returning method called puddle in Java getting a one-dimensional int array.

# Example Run #1:
Enter 10 numbers representing the rock formations in the valley: <br>
8 3 2 1 6 0 7 3 2 5 <br>
There can be maximum observable amount of hot lava is (in cells): 28 <br>

# Example Run #2:
Enter 10 numbers representing the rock formations in the valley: <br>
5 3 4 4 6 8 0 8 5 7 <br> 
There can be maximum observable amount of hot lava is (in cells): 14 <br>
